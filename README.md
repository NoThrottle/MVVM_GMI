# Global Minecraft Installer - Launcher

This is the 3rd iteration of GMI
- GMI Console (Java)
- GMI GUI (C#)
- GMI MVVM (C#)

This version uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) coding pattern to effectively separate the UI from the code base, allowing for a more fluid, clutter-free, and less tangled code base.

This code is All Rights Reserved (ARR), and does not use any code from the MIT-licensed GMI GUI or GMI Console.
